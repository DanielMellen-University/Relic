# Changelog

## Unreleased

Docs only, no language changes.

- New: [guide](docs/GUIDE.md), [language reference](docs/LANGUAGE.md), [command line and REPL](docs/CLI.md), [host built-ins and embedding](docs/HOST.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [examples/README.md](examples/README.md).
- The [docs index](docs/README.md) has a reading order for users and for contributors.
- DESIGN.md now holds the reasons and open questions; the rules moved to LANGUAGE.md and the engine internals to ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Fixed stale facts: self-host limits (`use std/...` works there), test counts, the std module list, the borrowed pieces list (now one list, in VISION.md).

## 1.0.1 (2026-10-20)

- Split the repo. The MONOLITH 2 desktop shell (`shell/wm.relic`, `shell/desktop.relic`) and its `shell_wm` golden test moved to [M0N0LITH-2](https://github.com/DanielMellen-University/M0N0LITH-2), history included. Relic is now the language only.
- The planned Relic IDE moved from Relic's roadmap to M0N0LITH-2's, as a planned app.
- Docs call `examples/mini_desktop/` what it is: a small language example, not the real environment.
- No language, std or engine changes.

## 1.0.0

- First release, tag `v1.0.0`. Work after it (modules, std, self-host, VM, graphics, M7 to M11) landed on main without a version bump. See [PROJECT_PLAN.md](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md).
